# Local .dev tld with dynamic apache vhost setup.

Because I keep forgetting how to set this up. These config files are my
reminders.

1. Apache2 is default on OSX.
2. Install dnsmasq through `brew`.

`apache2/extra/httpd-vhost.conf` > `/private/etc/apache2/extra/`
`dnsmasq.d/address.dev.conf` > `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/`
